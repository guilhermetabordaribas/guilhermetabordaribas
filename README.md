### Hi there, I'm Guilherme :man_technologist::dna:

My main focus now is to develop softwares and workflows to help improve the Bioinformatics area, as well as to bring relevant answers using machine learning applied to molecular biology and health.

My secondary goal is to teach programming and applications to all people who aspire to become developers. That's why I keep some free video tutorials about programming for science and finance on YouTube and some posts on Instagram.

* [Bioinformatics on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sclab.sci)

I'm fluent in Python and R languages. But I also have experience with C++, Java, Javascript and Matlab.
